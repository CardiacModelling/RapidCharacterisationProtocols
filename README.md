# Rapid Characterisation Protocols for patch-clamp electrophysiology
Collection of protocols for rapid characterisation of ion channel kinetics, in both plain text `.txt` and comma-separated-value `.csv` formats.

## Sinusoidal voltage clamp for hERG/IKr measurements

The first protocol is `sinewave-ramp` which is a slightly-updated version of the sinusoidal voltage clamp we first published in 2018 (which has a dedicated [Github repository](http://www.github.com/mirams/sine-wave)). The update here is a ramp during the initial 'leak step' rather than a fixed potential.

# Format/Units
Each file has two columns, the first one is time (in [seconds]) and the second column is voltage (in [milliVolts]).
